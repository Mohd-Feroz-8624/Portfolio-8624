            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in
            Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), where I am building a strong
            foundation in programming, problem-solving, and both frontend and
            backend technologies to shape a successful career in the tech
            industry. I have completed advanced courses in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and I am proficient in full-stack development using
            modern frameworks like React. Currently, Iâ€™m applying this knowledge
            by working on real-world projects such as a Sticky Notes App with
            CRUD operations and local storage integration to enhance my
            practical skills.

            In addition, I am expanding my knowledge in Database Management
            Systems (DBMS), Operating Systems, and Computer Organization, while
            also exploring Data Science, Machine Learning, and DevOps for future
            growth. I am passionate about creating impactful web applications
            and continuously improving myself through consistent learning and
            real-world application of technology.
